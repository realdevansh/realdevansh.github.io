 Hello!! This website is under construction! So please don't mind jumbled mess of everything everywhere!!
</p>

I am Devansh Bhatnagar. This is my very basic blogging website, for people interested in my work and wishing to keep up with me and my projects. I love learning and deep research and Computer Science is one rabbit hole after another! My true passion is learning and solving problems in creative ways. I enjoy tinkering with machines and electronics. I am very bad at coding but I love programming! If you want to see more of my stuff, check out my [Blogs](https://realdevansh.github.io/archive).

I believe you are familiar with my Linkedin and GitHub!
